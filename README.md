# RTL8852BE diagnostic driver

This is an experimental diagnostic service, not a working Wi-Fi driver.
Target: x86-64 macOS, PCI 10ec:b852, subsystem 1a3b:5470.

## Current version: 0.0.5 (supply-cycle hardware test pending)

The proven PCI/MMIO/XTAL preflight remains. With digital cut 1, analog byte 0x11,
PCI bus mastering off and MAC state initially off, this experiment runs the
RTL8852B supply/isolation sequence and then its shutdown sequence in the same
call. Cleanup is also attempted after partial power-on failure. No DMAC/CMAC
function enabling, DMA queues, firmware upload or network transmission is added.

Power writes now include masked analog XTAL commands and allowlisted system
registers. Polls and whole sequences are bounded. A successful result requires
MAC active observed, shutdown complete, MAC returned off and PCI configuration
restored. Cleanup failure is reported distinctly; this is not an exact register
snapshot rollback. See [power-sequence.md](docs/power-sequence.md) for scope,
timeout behavior, reference provenance, tests and remaining hardware uncertainty.

The existing recovery collector captures IORegistry and requests a reboot without
terminal input. The driver does not reboot or modify NVRAM itself.

## Evidence and remaining work

- 0.0.1: physical matching and PCI/resource capture confirmed on macOS 15.4.1.
- 0.0.2: earlier NVRAM experiment failed; retired, cause not established.
- 0.0.3: Apple build, ASan/UBSan tests and physical register reads passed on
  macOS 15.4.1. SYS_CFG1 was 0x0C491D39 twice, SYS_STATUS1 was 0x1401F278;
  PCI Command was 0 -> 2 -> 0, and automatic collection/reboot completed.
- 0.0.4: physical XTAL read passed: raw analog revision 0x11, one command,
  two polls in 75 us, power register unchanged, PCI Command restored to 0.
- 0.0.5: supply-cycle implementation and host tests; physical result pending.
- Not implemented: firmware upload, RF initialization, DMA queues, TX/RX, scan,
  association, WPA authentication, or an IO80211 network interface.

The CI workflow builds with the pinned MacKernelSDK and Apple toolchain, tests
PCI parsing and the MMIO transaction with ASan/UBSan mocks, and validates the
Mach-O bundle. It does not load kernel code on the CI host.

## Firmware preparation (offline; not installed)

`src/FirmwarePlan.hpp` selects a normal CE/normal image for the exact chip-cut
field, validates the multi-image container and v0 sections, and enumerates bounded
2020-byte payload chunks. There is no allocation or OS dependency in this module.
All failures clear its output. Unsupported layouts are rejected. Dynamic feature
records remain opaque; file-layout acceptance is not firmware ABI compatibility,
cryptographic verification, hardware checksum verification or permission to DMA.

The unchanged fixture in `firmware/` is pinned by source commit and SHA-256 and
retains its separate Realtek license. Test data corruption uses synthetic data.
`tools/firmware_inspect.cpp` produces a JSON layout without writing to hardware.
CI runs ASan/UBSan tests, a bounded libFuzzer campaign, both real cut-1/cut-2
images, and a compile-only check under the kernel SDK. This module is not linked
into the live 0.0.3 driver. See `docs/firmware-bringup.md` for remaining dependencies.

Project source uses BSD-3-Clause. The firmware binary is **not** BSD-licensed;
see `firmware/LICENCE.rtlwifi_firmware.txt` and `firmware/provenance.json`.
Referenced SDK/reference code retains its original licenses. The Linux wireless
stack, firmware transport and hardware initialization have not been ported.
